3a. If passed an argument, exec.c overtakes the current running process and runs the program given as the argument.

3b. If the execve() function runs into some sort of error, like the passed in program doesn't exist, then the original process
maintains control and the final print statement will be executed.

3c. hiltoni@texas:~/Documents/CS324/fork_exec_lab/hw3$ ./exec /bin/cat

3d.
hiltoni@texas:~/Documents/CS324/fork_exec_lab/hw3$ ps -p 29576 -o user,pid,ppid,state,ucmd
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
hiltoni  29576 28311 S exec
hiltoni@texas:~/Documents/CS324/fork_exec_lab/hw3$ ps -p 29576 -o user,pid,ppid,state,ucmd
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
hiltoni  29576 28311 S cat

3e. The pid and ppid are the same between the two outputs, the state is identical between the outputs, but the command is different. During the initial sleep, the command is exec because ......
After the exec call, the command is cat, because as a result of the exec, the program is now running the cat program.
